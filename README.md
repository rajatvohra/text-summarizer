this project aims to develop text_summarizer using different techniques.
Techniques:
   1)Basic(frequency sorting method):(completed) Ranking sentences on the basis of the frequency of words(other than stop / common words)

   2)Intermediate(Pagerank method):(completed) ranking sentences using the pagerank algo that is similiar to the one developed by google to rank webpages for its search engine.

   3)Advanced(Deep learning method): (yet to start/working on it) : while the previous 2 algos work on extractive summarization i.e to use the same words given in the content , this algo works on abstractive summariztion i.e to make its own sentences with the help of different encoders and decoders.

How to use :
    1)install all the requirements with pip(run the command pip install requirements.txt)
    2)then run "text_summarizer.py" and enter the type of algo you want frequency based or rank based .
    3)then enter the url of the page for which you need the summary for.
    4)then enter whether you just want the headline or do you need the summary as well.
